## Powershell Books

This is a really great book and one of the first PowerShell books that I dove into after completing a training video on the old training site "Microsoft Virtual Academy".\
<a href="https://www.manning.com/books/learn-powershell-in-a-month-of-lunches">"PowerShell in a Month of Lunches"</a>\
Another great book that I have read that helped and continues to help with building more than just one-line PowerShell scripts was the following book.\
<a href="https://www.manning.com/books/learn-powershell-toolmaking-in-a-month-of-lunches">"PowerShell Toolmaking in a Month of Lunches"</a>\
I also find that history of PowerShell is a very interesting read and the following book does a great job.\
<a href="https://donjones.com/books/shell-of-an-idea/">"Shell of an Idea"</a>\
Another book that I have been able to use for various parts of my job have come from this book and it can spur additional thought process.\
<a href="https://nostarch.com/powershellsysadmins">"Powershell for Sys Admins"</a>

## Windows System Deployment

Some very good reading and practice for deploying Windows 10.\
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Deployment-Fundamentals-Vol-Deploying-Microsoft/dp/9187445212/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1587931453&sr=1-4">"Deployment Fundamentals Vol. 6"</a>\
This is the volume before the above book but is also very good information and things to learn from.\
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Deployment-Fundamentals-Vol-Real-World-Infrastructure/dp/9187445093/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1587931453&sr=1-5">"Deployment Fundamentals Vol. 5"</a>

## Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (SCCM)

This is a good book to get some history on the SCCM product and get some information.\
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/System-Center-2012-Configuration-Manager/dp/9187445085/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=">"System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager: Mastering the Fundamentals"</a>\
Another good book to expand knowledge on SCCM.\
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-System-Center-Configuration-Manager/dp/1119258456">"Mastering System Center Configuration Manager"</a>\
A book that I have used as well for SCCM Current Branch.\
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/System-Configuration-Manager-Current-Unleashed/dp/0672337908/ref=pd_lpo_2?pd_rd_w=LcUCN&content-id=amzn1.sym.116f529c-aa4d-4763-b2b6-4d614ec7dc00&pf_rd_p=116f529c-aa4d-4763-b2b6-4d614ec7dc00&pf_rd_r=VZWABP1BF4S7918K6SKE&pd_rd_wg=GBlw3&pd_rd_r=c3cbe0c1-bd83-42ce-98fa-8dbe10b57777&pd_rd_i=0672337908&psc=1">"System Center Configuration Manager Current Branch Unleashed"</a>

This page will continue to be updated as I come across more books that I have learned from.\
