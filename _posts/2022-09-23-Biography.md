Well, a little about me and my history. I am a Minnesota native that went to college at North Dakota State University in Fargo, ND.\

I started working at The Home Depot so many years ago now that I think about it. I worked part time in the paint department for several months before transitioning over to the flooring and blinds department. As I was graduating from college with my Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration I was also promoted to a department supervisor over the Lumber, Building Materials, and the Pro Desk. I continued working at the Fargo Home Depot until 2007 and transitioned to be the department supervisor over kitchen & bath, plumbing, and appliances.\
Around 2007 an opportunity came up to open a brand new Home Depot store in Maple Grove, MN. I was able to come down and be the department supervisor over kitchen & bath, plumbing, and appliances. It was during the opening of that store that a part time plumbing associate was hired amongst many other associates. The reason the part time plumbing associate is important to my current path is that he worked in IT as a consultant. He and I shared very similar interest like bowling, golf, and helping people. Through many conversations discussions of IT and computers came up frequently. He was able to help get things into my hands to help grow my IT skills and peaked my interest in IT.
I was able to work with Ubuntu, Adobe Creative Suite, and GIMP during my time of work with him and discovered that I really enjoyed working with all of those things.\
I continued to grow and work my retail management skills and was able to promote to a salaried manager at Home Depot at the St. Louis Park Home Depot. I was the Merchandising Assistant Store Manager for the plumbing and hardware departments. I was able to continue growing my leadership and retail management skills during my time at St. Louis Park Home Depot. Then a transition was done to move me to the Richfield Home Depot.\

I transitioned to the Richfield Home Depot as a Marchandising Assistant Store Manager. I was able to tranisition to the Specialty Assistant Store Manager while at Richfield. I expanded my skills in working with vendors, customers, and associates in that position. I transitioned to the Operations Assistant Store Manager and a portion of that role included managing the Tool Rental at that location. I was able to work with a tool tech that was a great teacher and mentor. He taught me how to work on small engines and repair tools. It was incredible to take things that were broken and non-functional and repair them to a working state. It was around this time as well that the part time associate from Maple Grove and I had discussions about what it was like working in IT.\

It was March of 2014 that I lost my mother at the age of 59. It was very sudden despite her having health issues for the previous several years. Losing my mother had quite the affect on me. I started to evaluate things in my life. There were times as a manager when customers would be upset and complaining to me about their situation that it was hard not to look at them and share how there are things in life more important than what they were upset about. My father passed away December of 2015. He was fighting stomach cancer and had thyroid cancer. He fought a good fight and was able to attend and be part of my husband and I's wedding in August of 2015.
Even with the loss of my parents I continued to work at Home Depot in Richfield but the time was winding down that I would be at the Home Depot.\

There was a good process that started in two different areas while my time was winding down with Home Depot. There was an associate that worked at the Richfield Home Depot that her spouse worked for a local county in the foster care system. She was able to connect my husband and I up to foster care licensing and the process that would allow us to adopt. There will be more of posts on that in the near future. Cutting forward in time my husband and I were able to a few foster children and eventually fostered three amazing children. We foster our kids until we were finally able to adopt them in April of 2019 which was such an amazing and emotional day.\
The other portion of time that was used during the last chunk of time at Home Depot the part time plumbing associate told me I needed to learn PowerShell, that it would be able to open doors for me. So I worked on learning PowerShell through several different paths which I will also share in a blog post on here as well.\
Home Depot and I separated ways in January of 2017. There was an almost 6 month period of being unemployed which is very stressful but I used the time to continue learning and training on as much of PowerShell and IT training that I could. In July of 2017 I was able to land a role as a General Manager for Caribou Coffee. I was able to learn how to make coffee and work in quick service. I was able to discover and learn many things but during the short time I was with Caribou Coffee I learned quick service was not for me. I parted was with Caribou Coffee in December of 2017.\
In January of 2018, the part time associate from Maple Grove Home Depot had been through a few contract jobs in IT and was currently working at Andersen Windows in Bayport, MN. They had an opening for a field technician to work at their Tech Cafe. He mentioned to the manager for the contract company and the Andersen manager that he knew someone that would be a really good fit and could get them my resume. I was able to interview and got the position. It was a change from my previous retail / quick service work history, but there were so many things that I found from those backgrounds that played into the IT role at the Tech Cafe.\
I was able to transition into the End Point Architect role at Andersen Windows. In that role I worked with packaging applications, working with SCCM, Active Directory, Group Policy, Azure Active Directory, Windows 7, Windows 10 and Office 365. I was able to really work on so many learning opportunities while I was there and PowerShell was a very large part of so many things that I did. I was able to use the Powershell App Deploy Toolkit to help with packaging applications. As time goes on and I have opportunities I will share things that I have done or resources that I have used to solve the problems I have come across.\
I was at Andersen Windows for a few years and was able to convert to an employee there. However, an opportunity came up that allowed me to transition to another company for an increased wage. With discussions with my husband we determined that it would be a good opportunity for me to experience more environments and getting paid more to do it also helped in the decision. I was able to work at the next company as a contrato doing very similar work that I had done at Andersen Windows with SSCCM, Active Directory, Group Policy, Azure Active Directory, Windows 7, Windows 10 and Office 365. The contract was ended 3 months earlier than intended and I was let go from that job, which is another experience to share in a different blog post.\
I was able to find another contract job that I am currently at that has very similar work than what I have done before with a bunch of new experiences as well. This role has me going more into the Operational Technology versus the Information Technology field which is fun and exciting. I always loved to work with the production process and systems at Andersen Windows and this no company also has a very large manufacturing business.\
Well that is all for now and some stories are to be continued...\
