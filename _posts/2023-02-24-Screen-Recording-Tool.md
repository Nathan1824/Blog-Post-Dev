### Great Screen Capture Tool

Just two days ago I needed to gather some screenshots of some setup steps for a project I am working on for work. I had a recollection from a previous coworker that shared the Step Recorder tool with me at a previous job. Of course, I could not think of the name of the tool but with some Googling I was able to find the Problem Steps Recorder tool. It is a built-in tool for Windows 10 / Windows 11 and does a really good job.\
This tool was the key I needed to capture all the steps and be able to use them in documentation. This is just one tool that can be used to capture screen shots for documentation and did a good job for what I needed.\
For reference on the Probem Step Recorder tool and M365:

I have also used ShareX as a screen capture tool and may throw a blog together for some of the basic things that I have used that for in writing documentation. It is a free use tool that has multiple install options.\

I have also gotten to use SnagIt for screen capturing as well. It is a good screen capture tool but does have license costs associated with it.\

Everyone have great last weekend in February.
