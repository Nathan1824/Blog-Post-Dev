### Using Some Monitors but not All

So, I did not plan to write blog posts that are referenced or tied off someone elseâ€™s blog posts, but when I find something that I have come across myself as an issue or struggle I think it should be fair to share it with the community. This issue I have come across myself is having multiple monitors to work on and utilizing RDP to remote machines. I want to use some of the monitors but not necessarily all the monitors and when connecting I came across that you can either use all the monitors or one monitor.\

I found the blog article from Scott Hanselman on Twitter and was totally excited to find this.\

So, I will try to throw out things that I find on my own but if I find some great things that have come in handy for solving issues that I have myself I will borrow with pride and share the source to give credit.\
Have a great weekend!
