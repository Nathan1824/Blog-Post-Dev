So this is a first pass at having a functional blog post out on the inter-webs. I do hope that this can be a place to try and share knowledge and
pass on the things that I can help others.
I have a very interesting work history and I am planning on utilizing this GitHub page blog post to help share some of my past, present, and future.
I do hope that this is received well and I can continue to build more and more into this blog post.
