### Vacation Time - Dublin Day Three

Our third day started out with a walk down the Liffey River towards the Poolbeg Lighthouse and the plan was to stop at the Custom’s House, the Central Bank of Ireland Visitor Center and then hit up the lighthouse.\
The Custom’s House was an awesome place to stop and visit. We did pay for a guided tour and were lucky enough that a private group did not show up so that we got to walk the tour with the guide and two of us. The history and information shared was very incredible and great to hear. Definitely recommend visiting the Custom’s House if in Dublin.\

After that we walked down towards the Poolbeg Lighthouse and on the way we walked past a really cool sailing ship called the Jeanie Johnston. We did not tour the ship as we had the opportunity to walk an old sailing ship in Boston harbor several years ago. If you have never been on an old sailing ship, it is totally worth touring one just to see how those ships are built and were operated.\

We continued the walk down to the Central Bank of Ireland but sadly the visitor center was not open. It did look very interesting online so if you are in Dublin and have the opportunity I would think it is still worth trying to visit. After reexamining the map we determined that to continue walking to the Poolbeg Lighthouse would have been a considerable walk so we decided to head back to the hotel and rest a minute.\
After a short rest at the hotel, we went to Christ Church Cathedral. It was a very beautiful building and they have a really good audio self-guided tour that you get access to with payment. The church cathedral was amazing to walk around and the crypt below had some really cool things to look at while down there.\

Finishing up there we hit up a pub in the main area and had fish and chips which were really good before heading to the Chester Beatty museum that is open to the public. There were really amazing displays in there to look through and I would definitely recommended seeing that as well.\
