### Vacation Time - Dublin Last Day

Today was the last day in Dublin, it was a sad day to be leaving but looking forward to being back at home. We had a 1:25 PM flight out of Dublin and had a van to take us to the airport. The flight was with KLM airlines, it was my first time on board that carrier. The first leg of the trip was from Dublin Ireland to Amsterdam. That flight was only 2 hours long and we were 4 rows from the front of the plane in economy. The staff were great on the aircraft despite a short delay for a customs issue leaving Dublin.\

After arriving in Amsterdam which we arrived on time, we had less than an hour to board the plane for Minneapolis. It was a beautiful Dreamliner aircraft for KML as well. This plane ride was one we were not looking forward to as it was supposed to be an eight-hour flight. The seats we got for this flight were all the way at the back of the economy section on the port side. I was not the happiest that we did not get to pick our seats for this flight but just wanted to get home. On the way through boarding, we were selected for additional security screening. They had to swap our hands belt area and socks and test it in a machine, we passed, laughing out loud.\
The person that sat with us on the way back had been visiting with family in Scotland and lived in Canada and was very nice to sit next to on such a long plane ride.\
Once we were back and through customs, we retrieved our checked bag, and we were on our way home from the airport. It was good to be back but will miss Ireland. Now to catch up on some sleep and get back into the flow of daily life. The blog posts will be going back to more technical posts, but it was fun to share some of my vacation.
