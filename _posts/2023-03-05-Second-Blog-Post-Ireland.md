### Vacation Time - Dublin Day One.  

Today we arrived in Dublin at Dublin Heuston Station by rail. It was very easy to travel from Cork to Dublin by train, the only thing to be aware of was that even with a first class ticket we shared a four-seat table with two other people. They were very nice, but it is something to be aware of if traveling by train. The countryside was very nice and rolling with cattle farms in between the cities as well as some wind farms along the way. The train from Cork to Dublin only had four other stops once we left Cork.\
Once we got to Dublin it was easy to hail a cab with the app “Free Now” and had less than 10 minutes wait for the ride to our studio apartment. Got to see the Guinness Store House outside the train station that we will be seeing either Monday or Tuesday and it is huge!\
On the first day we got to see Dublin Castle, which is very large and impressive from the outside. It is worth doing the tour of the castle which the entry way is in the middle courtyard of the castle. The rooms are magnificent, and the artwork is so beautiful, totally worth going to visit. There is also the Dubh Linn Garden, and the Garda Siochana Memorial Garden is totally worth it.\

We also took a walk around to the Irish Whiskey Museum and determined it looked like nothing more than whiskey tasting which is very good to do if you have not drunk as many different whiskey’s as myself.\
After that we walked back over by where we were staying and ate at Wallace’s Tavern and had delicious wine and pizza. While we were there we got to visit with a very lovely lady from Ireland. The biggest thing in Ireland is to make sure you book your dinner / lunch reservations ahead of time to make sure you get a table or be very flexible.\

We also discovered a very nice gay bar in Ireland called Street 66, the music was awesome and not to loud that we couldn’t converse with each other. There will be more to come as we head into Monday.\
