### Vacation Time. 
 
Writing this blog post from Ireland aboard a train from Cork to Dublin. We have been in Ireland since Thursday March 2nd and started in the city of Cork. I am a huge train fan and always look forward to riding on a train and I am writing this blog post from the train on the way to Dublin. The city of Cork was very walkable and so many good food places to visit. The Blarney Castle and gardens are totally worth a visit if down by Cork. Standing in front of the castle you can understand the intimidation affect they had on people that needed to come visit.\

After spending 3 – 4 hours visiting the castle on my birthday we went out for a late lunch at a wonderful pub in Blarney called “Muskerry Arms Bar and B&B Blarney”. The food was excellent and the atmosphere was very home town feel. We also had delicious dinner on Thursday night March 2nd at Elbow Lane Brew & Smoke House on Oliver Plunkett Street, we were very lucky to get a table. Reservations at restaurants in Ireland is a MUST or just be very very flexible. Friday night’s dinner was at Market Lane on Oliver Plunkett Street and we also were very very lucky to get seated at the bar. Was my first time trying monkfish and it was delicious.\

Then last night Saturday March 4th we were able to get in at White Rabbit Bar & BBQ on MacCurtain Street. Delicious BBQ and the bar tender was fantastic. 
Our plans are filled with places for visiting in Dublin, we will have Sunday March 5th through Tuesday March 7th to visit all the places in Dublin.\
More to come on this blog post about Ireland as the time goes by for us to fly back to the United States.\
