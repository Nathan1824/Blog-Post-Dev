We started off the morning by going to Trinity College and booked the tour for the Book of Kells. While we waited to start our tour, we walked over to St. Stephen’s Green Park and the shopping center right by the park. The shopping center was cool. We were able to walk through the library at Trinity College and see the Book of Kells, the book dates to 800 A.D. and it is very impressive to see. The library itself is very amazing to see as well if you are a book lover.\

Then we went back to where we were staying as we wanted to go to the Guinness Store House and the Jameson Distillery. It was a trip for a taxi ride which is always nice. The Guinness Store House is worth touring to see all the process of making beer. We did up to pay the extra to get our picture put into the foam on the Guinness beer which is very good to do for a picture and the experience. The 1837 restaurant had amazing food and the staff was super friendly. I had Salmon, and it was delicious. The Gravity Bar at the top is also amazing to enjoy a pint and walk around to look at the amazing skyline of Dublin.\
Our cab ride over to the Jameson Distillery was awesome and the driver was able to give us some awesome history and was even able to show us some awesome historical things on the way between the Guinness Brew House. There will be more pictures to come as the driver was able to take our picture at the entryway to the Jameson Distillery.\

We were able to do the secret tasting at the Jameson Distillery, which was worth the experience. We got to taste three different types of Jameson and they were all very good and very different from each other. It is worth the experience to stop at the Jameson Distillery. The bartender Mark was also amazing and made an awesome Old Fashioned.\
Tuesday will have more places to stop by and visit so until then…it is time for bed. Ciao!\
